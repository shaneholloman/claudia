# Capability Suggester Skill

**Triggers:** Activates when patterns of repeated behavior reach a threshold, or when structural gaps create friction.

---

## Philosophy

Structure should grow organically from actual needs, not be imposed upfront. This skill watches for both repeated behaviors and structural friction, offering targeted solutions.

**Core Principles:**
- Observe before suggesting
- One suggestion at a time, not a flood
- Accept "no" gracefully
- Remember declined suggestions (don't re-suggest)
- Explain the why, not just the what

---

## What I Watch For

### Repeated Tasks

**Detection:**
- Same type of request 3+ times in a week
- Manual process that could be templated
- Multi-step workflow repeated frequently

**Examples:**
```
"I notice you draft LinkedIn posts almost daily.
Want me to add a /linkedin-quick command for faster posting?"

"You've asked me to summarize meeting notes 5 times this week.
Should we add this to your standard meeting capture flow?"
```

### Frequent Queries

**Detection:**
- Same question asked regularly
- Status checks on specific topics
- Information retrieval patterns

**Examples:**
```
"You often ask about project status on Mondays.
Should I add a project summary to your morning brief automatically?"

"You check on pipeline status frequently.
Want me to create a /pipeline-quick command for a one-line summary?"
```

### Workflow Gaps

**Detection:**
- Steps that are often forgotten
- Manual connections between automated parts
- Handoffs that could be smoother

**Examples:**
```
"After meetings, you usually update commitments manually.
Should I automatically suggest commitment updates after /capture-meeting?"

"You often forget to update the client file after calls.
Want me to prompt for client file updates after meeting captures?"
```

### Structure Needs

**Detection:**
- Files created outside the existing structure repeatedly
- Topics that don't have a home
- Files that are getting too long
- Categories that are emerging

**Examples:**
```
"I notice you've been saving [X] type files in random places.
Want me to create a dedicated folder for those?"

"You've created 3 client notes in /context.
Should we set up proper client folders?"

"Your patterns.md is getting long. Want me to split it into
work-patterns.md and relationship-patterns.md?"
```

### Business Depth Upgrades

If user chose "minimal" or "starter" initially, watch for signs they need more:

**Minimal to Starter:**
- Mentions tracking multiple things manually
- Asks about pipelines or active work lists
- Discusses finances more than occasionally

**Starter to Full:**
- Manages 3+ active clients/projects
- Needs accountability tracking
- Discusses methodology or repeatable processes
- Mentions tax planning or financial complexity

**Suggest:**
```
"Your workflow has gotten more complex since we started. Want me to add:
- Pipeline tracking (active, prospecting, completed)
- Financial structure (expenses, invoicing, tax planning)
- Templates for common tasks

I can add just what you need, not everything at once."
```

### Integration Needs

**Detection:**
- User mentions checking external tools frequently
- User pastes content from external services
- User asks "can you see my X" type questions
- User manually copies information that could be automated
- References to specific services (Gmail, Notion, Slack, etc.)

**Trigger Phrases:**
- "Can you check my email/calendar/Notion..."
- "Let me paste this from [service]..."
- "I need to go look at [service] for..."
- "Can you see my [service]?"

**Response:**
Invoke the `connector-discovery` skill with context about what they were trying to do.

**Examples:**
```
"I notice you often paste content from Notion. Want me to see
if I can connect directly? That way I could search and read
your pages without the copy-paste."

"You've asked about your email a few times. I can't see it yet,
but I can help you set that up. Takes about 5 minutes for Gmail.
Interested?"
```

**Guardrails:**
- Only suggest once per service (check declined list in learnings.md)
- Don't interrupt workflow, suggest at natural pause points
- If they said "maybe later" during onboarding, wait at least a week

---

## Suggestion Flow

### 1. Observe Pattern

Track behavior without mentioning it until threshold reached:
- 3+ occurrences for simple tasks
- 2+ for complex workflows
- Immediate for obvious improvements

### 2. Wait for a Natural Moment

**Good times to suggest:**
- Start of session: "Before we dive in, I noticed something..."
- End of weekly review: "One observation from reviewing your week..."
- After completing a task: "That's done. Quick thought..."
- When they mention friction: "You mentioned [X] being messy. Want me to..."

**Bad times:**
- During focused work
- When user is stressed
- If pattern is sensitive and context is wrong

### 3. Propose Enhancement

**Format:**
```
"I've noticed [observation].

Would you like me to [specific solution]?

This would [benefit].

Totally fine if not - just noticed the pattern."
```

### 4. Accept Response

**If yes:**
- Create the enhancement immediately
- Show what was added
- Offer a quick tour if it's substantial
- Note in learnings.md

**If "not now" / "maybe later":**
- Note the suggestion and timing
- Wait at least 2 weeks before similar suggestions
- Acknowledge: "No problem. I'll let you know if the pattern continues."

**If "no" / declined:**
- Record the declined suggestion
- Don't suggest the same thing again (unless they explicitly ask)
- Acknowledge: "Got it. Won't mention it again."

## Types of Suggestions

### New Commands

**Process:**
1. Draft command based on observed pattern
2. Propose to user with explanation
3. If approved, create in `.claude/skills/`
4. Confirm creation and explain usage

### Workflow Enhancements

**Modifications to existing flows:**
- Add steps to existing commands
- Connect previously separate processes
- Add automation triggers

**Example:**
```
"Currently /capture-meeting extracts decisions and commitments.

Want me to enhance it to also:
- Update the person file with meeting date
- Add any new people mentioned to your list
- Suggest follow-up timing based on meeting content?"
```

### Structure Changes

**New folders or files:**
- Create folder for emerging category
- Split growing files
- Add templates for new types

---

## Tracking Suggestions

Maintain in `context/learnings.md`:

```markdown
## Suggested Capabilities

### Accepted
- /linkedin-quick command (created Jan 15)
- Auto-client-update after meetings (enabled Jan 18)
- Pipeline tracking folders (created Feb 1)

### Declined (Don't Re-suggest)
- Partnership folder (user prefers flat structure)
- Automatic deadline reminders (user finds them annoying)
- Full pipeline structure - prefers minimal

### Pending
- Sales follow-up template (user said "maybe later" - Jan 20)
```

### Feedback Loop

Track whether suggestions are used:
- Command created but never used → Note for learning
- Command used frequently → Validated pattern
- Enhancement enabled then disabled → Preference noted

## Suggestion Library

### For Users Who Started Minimal

**Pipeline Tracking:**
```
"You've mentioned 3 different clients this week but don't have a pipeline.
Want me to set up tracking so you can see active work at a glance?"
```

**Financial Tracking:**
```
"I notice you discuss finances fairly often. Your setup is minimal right now.
Want me to add an overview file for tracking revenue and expenses?"
```

**Commitments Tracking:**
```
"You've made several promises this week. Want me to set up a dedicated
commitments tracker so nothing slips through?"
```

### For Users Who Started Starter

**Full Pipeline:**
```
"Your pipeline is getting busier. Want me to add prospecting and completed
tracking so you can see your full sales funnel?"
```

**Templates Library:**
```
"You do a lot of similar tasks. Want me to set up a templates folder with
starting points for client intake, meeting prep, and reviews?"
```

### For All Users

**Weekly Review Template:**
```
"You do informal weekly reviews. Want me to create a template so you hit
the same key areas each time?"
```

**Methodology Documentation:**
```
"You've described how you approach [X] a few times. Want me to document it
so you (and I) can reference it consistently?"
```

**New Folder for Recurring Content:**
```
"You've created several [X] files. Want me to set up a dedicated folder
so they're easier to find?"
```

## Frequency Limits

- Maximum 1 suggestion per session (unless asked)
- Space out suggestions over time
- Wait 2 weeks after any suggestion before the next
- Exception: If they ask "what should I add?" give fuller recommendations

---

## Guardrails

### Don't Overwhelm
- Max 1 suggestion per session (unless asked)
- Don't repeat declined suggestions
- Space suggestions over time

### Don't Over-Engineer
- Start with simple solutions
- Only suggest what's clearly needed
- Avoid adding complexity for its own sake

### Respect User Style
- Some users like lots of structure
- Some prefer minimal tooling
- Learn and adapt to their preference

---

## Integration

### With Pattern Recognizer
- Feed patterns into capability analysis
- Notice when patterns suggest tooling needs

### With Commitment Detector
- When commitments pile up without a system, suggest tracking
- Suggest /what-am-i-missing command if not present

### With Risk Surfacer
- When risks relate to structural gaps, suggest structure
- Missing pipeline causes capacity issues → Suggest pipeline

### With Memory Manager
- Persist suggestions and responses
- Track what works over time

### With Onboarding
- During initial setup, note user preferences for suggestions
- Some users want lots of suggestions, others want minimal
