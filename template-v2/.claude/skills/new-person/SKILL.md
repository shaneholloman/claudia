Want me to:
- Add more details?

- Non-Latin names: Preserve original, add romanization if provided

## Minimal vs. Full

**Minimal** (quick capture):
- Name, role, how you met
- Creates basic file
- Fills in more over time

**Full** (when user has time):
- All template fields
- Contact information
- Communication preferences
- Current context
- History

Ask: "Quick capture or full profile?"
