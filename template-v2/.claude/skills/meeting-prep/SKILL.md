# Meeting Prep

One-page briefing before a call or meeting.

## Usage
`/meeting-prep [person or meeting name]`

Or naturally:
- "Prep me for my call with Sarah"
- "Meeting prep for the Acme quarterly"
- "What should I know before talking to Jim?"

## What to Gather

### Primary: Deep Context (one call)

Call the `memory_deep_context` MCP tool with the person's name. This returns everything in one round trip: entity info, all memories, connected entities, temporal items (commitments, observations), and episode history. Use this data for all sections below.

If deep_context is unavailable, fall back to sequential calls: `memory_about` for the entity, then `memory_recall` for broader context.

### 1. Person Context
From `memory_deep_context` result (or `people/[person].md` as fallback):
- Role and organization
- Relationship history
- Last contact and topics
- Communication style
- What matters to them

### 2. Open Items
From the temporal section of deep_context results:
- Commitments to them
- Commitments from them
- Waiting items

### 3. Recent Context
From the episodes section of deep_context results, plus linked documents.

Also check:
- Last meeting notes (if any)
- Recent email threads (if available)
- Any project/client context

### 4. Strategic Context
- What's the purpose of this meeting?
- What outcome would be good?
- Any concerns to be aware of?

*Anything else to prepare?*
```

## Tone

- Concise — one page max
- Actionable — clear talking points
- Contextual — relevant history surfaced
- Strategic — not just facts but suggested approach

## Without Prior Context

If no file exists for this person:
"I don't have context on [Person] yet. Would you like to:
1. Tell me about them now (quick capture)
2. Create a full person file
3. Proceed with what you know"

## Group Meetings

For meetings with multiple people:
- Brief context on key attendees
- Focus on meeting purpose
- Common threads across attendees
