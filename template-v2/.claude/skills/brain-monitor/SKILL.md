# Brain Monitor

Launch the Brain Monitor, a live terminal dashboard showing real-time memory activity.

**Triggers:** `/brain-monitor`, "brain monitor", "show dashboard", "memory dashboard", "terminal brain", "open the monitor"

## Launch

Run this command:

```bash
claudia system-health --project-dir "$PWD" --pretty
```

This shows a comprehensive system health report. For continuous monitoring, use the Brain Visualizer instead (see `/brain` skill).

If the `claudia` CLI is not found, it's not installed. Tell the user:
`npm install -g get-claudia && claudia setup`
